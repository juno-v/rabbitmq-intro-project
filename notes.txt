Learnings from RabbitMQ content

What is RabbitMQ? -IBM Technology
High overview: 
RabbitMQ is a simple and traditional pub/sub message broker system
async messaging
distributed deployment
management and monitoringextensiel through plugsins and tools 


Meaning one system communicates with another system through a msg que

Simple retail application has: 
check out service that needs to communicate with inventory service
- typically done through a TCP connection 
limitations:
        - as soon as a checkout sends a message it needs to hear a reply to move on to the next task
        - if inventory service went down, it would keep retrying over and over again until it makes that connection
        - if alot of checkouts happen at once, inventory service will not be able to keep up 
            - creating a bog down for the entire system

solution
    - create a message queues / message broker 
        - message broker : architectural pattern for message validation, transformation, and routing.
        - based on a first in first out basis
            - offers two message dist styles
                1) point to point
                2) pubs/sub 
    - message brokers sit inbetween the two services that need to communicate with one another
    - with a message que, a checkout service can add a message to the que, and immediately move on to the next task
        - similarly, the invetory service will consume from the que, process messsage, and immediately consume the next message
benefits
    - will decouple the two services
    - message broker helps with scalability 
    for example) if a lot of checkouts happen at once and the que begins to fill, you can have MORE than one consuming service to handle the ques/workloads
    - the que itself can sit on it's own machine 
        - this can offload some of the work that is done in the web application and create better performance
    
RabbitMQ
    - an implimention of AMQP message model 
        - specifically Advanced Message Queing Protocol Version 0-9-1
    - with this type of message model 
        - producer (checkout service) : instead of producing directly to a MSG que, it will produce to an EXCHANGE
        - think of exchange as a post office 
            - an exchange will recieve all the msgs then distribute them according to how they're addressed
            - an exchange can be connected to many queues
            for example) exchange is connected to TWO queues
                - queues are connected to the consumers, for example there is one calledd inventory and one called shipping 

Example 
checkout - send message to exchange
exchange - connected to queues through bindings
bindings - can be referenced by the binding key 
consumers - subscribe to the queues

AMQP, RabbitMQ is the message broker involving the exchange and binding keys (reference 4:10 in the video for picture )
benefits of message model
    - flexbility of how the msgs can move through the system
    - flexbility is largly in part due to the different types of exchanges are available

types of exchange
    - fanout : checkout will produce to the exchange, the exchange will duplicate msg and send it to every que that the exchange knows about
    - direct : checkout will produce the msg, then that msg will get a routing key 
        - the routing key is being compared to the binding key
        - if there is an exact match, the msg will move through the system accordingly
    - topic : partial martch between routing key and binding key 
        - if checkout sent a msg with a routing key = "ship.shoes" and a binding key = "ship.any"
            - with exchange type of topic 
            - it will gett routed through that que 
    - header : routing key is ignored, msgs will move through the system according to the header 
    - default (nameless): unique only to RabbitMQ
        - routing key = "inv" , routing key is tied to name of que itself
        - if que is named "inv" it will route through to that que's matched name 

benefits of RabbitMQ
    - tremendous flexbility of how to route messages 
    - can communicate from different servers or the same server
    - for example) can design system however you want instead of designing based on limitations and then designing accordingly
    - other message brokers, broker administrator's are usually defined on set up 
        - with RabbitMQ, the way that msgs are routed through the system is dependent on the metadata
            - the application and developer have control of how the msgs move through the system instead of the broker admin 
    - cloud friendly
        - easy to get started 
        - can deploy an instance on Docker or other containerization softwares
        - can run as a cluster
            - fault tolerant
            - highly available
            - high throughput
    - cross language communication
        - if a msg is produced by a service in GO, the other service can comsume by even Python or Java ect
    - good security 
        - supports FASL, LDAP, TLS for authentication and authorization
    - message acknowledgements
        - when a msg is in a que and goes to the consumer, the msg stays in the que until the consumer lets the broker know that it has recieved the msg, only then will msg be removed from que and prevents msg loss
    - great management
        - out of the box, there is great browser based management UI 
        - extensive CLI tools 
    - good open source community to enrich management and monitoring of RabbitMQ
        - created lots of plug ins to enrich most aspects of RabbitMQ
        - lots of tools, clients, lots of evolve that RabbitMQ now supports other message models aside from AMQP 0-9-1
            - msg models such as: MQTT, Stomp, AMQP 1.0
            - RabbitMq message model support docs here: https://www.rabbitmq.com/protocols.html
Big takeaways
    - flexbility with the way msgs move through the system
    - the fact that msg metadata defines how msgs move through the system as opposed to broker admin
    - super cloud friendly

Gives insight on how and where to use msg que and RabbitMQ in architecture 

Mainly used to allow applications to respond to requests quickly rather than forced to complete intensive procedures on the spot that will delay response time
Two applications/services will only communicate through the que, no direct relationship needed between servers or langauges
^ = low coupling between sender and reciever (this is good!)

More info and examples of Exchanges 
RabbitMq Explained - Exchanges - CloudAMQP 
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8eU5WiO8fw

- messages are not published directly to the que
- instead producer sends msgs through an exachange 
    - exchange can be seen as a mail delivary person that ensures the msg goes to the correct que 
- how an exchange is routed depends on:
    - exchange type
        - specifies routing rules, routing keys, and header attributes  
        - these are "addresses" for the msgs
- from que perspective
    - can check which exchanges and routing rules are linked to a specific que
    - link = bindings
    - a binding - links que to exchange, routing key = address for the message 
    - this is what the exchange looks for when deciding how to route the msg to ques 

4 main types of exchanges (examples start @ 1:40)
- direct
- topic
- fan out
- headers 

existing exchanges and types can be seen in management interface or through "rabbitmqadmin"

Good to knows 
RabbitMQ vs Kafka | Trade-off's to choose one over other : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMmRtSFQ5Z0

 - major reason why kafka > rabbitmq = retention of msgs. 
    - rabbitmq is just a plain point to point, once msg is consumed its deleted from que 
    - in kafka, can retain for a certain period and/or reconsume a msg from producer again 

RabbitMQ 
- variations of pub/sub
- request/response
- point to point patterns (to do: expand on what point to point communication is)
- smart broker model 
    - can levrate rabbitmq to intelligently route traffic across different queues
- can be synchronous/async
- push based approach
    - if producer pushes msg, it gets pushed to a specific que for that specific consumer
- helps priotize messages 
- deploys decoupled consumer queues 
    - for example, can have 2 different events pushed into a single que based on consumer pattern
    - dont have to tell the producer what you're consuming on the application 
    - intelligent smart routing logic that can be added within rabbitmq broker itself
    - on the other hand for kafka, have to plan ahead based if creating multiple partitions based on the type of events pushing onto topic
    - consumer logic coupled with platform when creating partitions/consumer groups 
    - ^ (explination @ 4:25)


Kafka
- pub/sub, generally used streaming platforms 
- smart consumer model 
    - levrages consumer to decide what kind of routes are taking in 
    - the broker itself doesn't take any rules/routing positions on type of msgs pushed into Kafka
- streaming log
    - mostly durable message store 
    - levrage to reply messages and rely on kafka for pulling msgs 
- pull based approach   
    - producer pushes in logs to kafka platform, consumer responsability is to pull msgs whenever they are available 
    - constantly pull the kafka broker for pulling msgs out of each partition/topic
- can order/retain/gurantee msgs 

Different use cases 

RabbitMQ 
- no event replays, will have to levrate producer to reply 
- no clear end to end architecture
    - don't know what how architecture will evolve
    - for example) we dont know if consumers have different types of events 
    - not having sight of how many consumers and what type of events those consumers will be taking
- no producer changes for consumer additions 
- langauge agnostic
    - can create multiple micro services support 

Kafka
- able to reply 
- streaming
- high throughput and scale quickly w/ micro services architecture for processing huge number of msgs 
- can provide majority of APIs to be consumed from speciifc languages, but rabbitmq provides more integrations than kafka

Limitations
RabbitMQ
- queues are single threaded
    - can scale, but only to the degree that the single thread can scale to 
- complex configurations with more brokers added    
    - complicated with 5+ brokers for example 
- no events reply 
- no native streaming supports
    - there are different libraries fro streaming capabilites, just not out the box 

Kafka
- storage overheads
    - think about storage costs 
    - stores for a long period of time and replicated for durability 
- streaming API for specific languages 
    - open source libraries coming up to levrage streaming APIs 
- ordering is restritive per partition 
    - if you want to create ordering across events and partitions you'll have to levreage joins, can't do out of the box 
- needs producer to coordinate with consumer for partition increases
